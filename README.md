# Welcome to cvc5-BatchSolver!

**cvc5-BatchSolver** is a Python tool for batch-processing `.smt2` files using the cvc5 solver and exporting detailed results to a single `.csv` file.

### üöÄ Why This Project?

While building [CRTSolver](https://github.com/maheenmatin/CRTSolver), a program that leverages the Chinese Remainder Theorem for increased performance in solving non-linear integer equations, I realized there was no easy way to batch-process a folder of SMT-LIB problems using cvc5 while retrieving:

- Satisfiability results
- Variable assignments (models) for satisfiable problems
- Solver runtime
- Problem metadata (e.g. max polynomial degree, number of variables, number of assertions, etc)

To evaluate CRTSolver against native cvc5 and Z3 performance, I built custom batch runners ‚Äî this tool is the result of generalizing and polishing that effort.

---

### üîç What It Does

- Recursively processes all `.smt2` files in a given folder
- Uses cvc5's **base Python API** (more feature-complete than the Pythonic API)
- For each file, extracts:
  - Solver status (`sat`, `unsat`, or `unknown`)
  - Model values (for satisfiable problems)
  - Solver runtime
  - Problem metadata
- Aggregates results into a clean, analyzable `.csv` file

### üß† Why It‚Äôs Different

Most SMT tools are solver-agnostic, and geared toward large-scale experiments with comparisons across different solvers and solver configurations. This project is:
- **Lightweight** and specifically **cvc5-focused**
- Optimized for **CSV output** and **donwstream analysis**
- Intended for **general use cases** where solving a batch of problems takes precedence over benchmarking
- **Easy to integrate** into solver pipelines or research workflows

---

### üì¶ Coming Soon
- Support for Z3 via a similar program
- CLI options for controlling timeout and file paths
